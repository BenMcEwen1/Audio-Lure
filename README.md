# Audio Lure

Intended for use on a Raspberry Pi (Development and testing using a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B)



## Microphone Specification and Setup
Full documentation on the Seeedstudio wiki:
https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker_Mic_Array_v2.0/

This implementation is a more bare bones version of the code provided by the supplier.
The relevant steps include:
* Configuration of 6 channel firmware
* Configuration of Direction of Arrival (DOA)

## Scripts:
### Run.py
Runs all of the scripts in the correct order. 
### lure.py
Selects an audio files from the pool of available audio files as configured by the user. If species and/or calltype are not specified then the script will randomly select one.
Plays the selected audio file
### record.py
Generates audio and DOA filenames given location, calltype, date and time info
Records for audio for 60 seconds and DOA information. Stores files using filenames generated by filename.py
### upload.py
Upload the audio recording to the Cacophony server using the API documentated here: https://api.cacophony.org.nz/
Upload the DOA info by storing it as 'additionalMetaData'

##### LED Ring 
Useful for testing. Currently configured to spin when selecting and playing audio lure and display DOA when recording. This should be tured off in the field by running:
```python
from pixel_ring import pixel_ring
pixel_ring.set_brightness(0x00)
```
